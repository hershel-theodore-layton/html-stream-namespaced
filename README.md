# html-stream-non-namespaced

HTML elements for sgml-stream in the HTL\HTMLStream namespace

**This repository only contains files written using codegen.**

If you want to contribute and your changes require edits to files which contain `This file is generated. Do not modify it manually!`, please open an issue first. In order to implement your suggested change, we'll need to change the codegen, instead of the public source code. Ideally, we would open source the codegen, which is a collection of ten short Hack files and some definitions in JSON. However, this code has not yet been reviewed. Also keep in mind that your changes will apply to both the namespaced and non-namespaced version of this library at once. We can bend the use clauses to work for either version. If you have a change which only applies to the HTMLStream namespace version, we'd love to understand your use case better first.

If your xhp code is written in the root namespace (as xhp-lib@v3 and below required), you might be interested in html tags defined in the root namespace. This removes the `use type` burden. You can find these tags in [html-stream-non-namespaced](https://github.com/hershel-theodore-layton/html-stream-non-namespaced).
